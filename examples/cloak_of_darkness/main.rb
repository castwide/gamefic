# Cloak of Darkness for Gamefic. 
# Gamefic implementation by Peter Orme. 
# Version 1.0.0 / 1 April 2014
# 
# Cloak of Darkness is a "hello world" example for interactive fiction.
# See http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/
# Based on the Inform7 implementation by Emily Short and Graham Nelson.

# Version 2.0.0 / 12 July 2014 by Fred Snyder
# Updated to use new features of Gamefic.
