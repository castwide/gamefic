# Rubble is Scenery with slightly modified action responses.
# Intended for things that might be portable but are useless.
# Rule of thumb: Scenery is something that can't be carried,
# like a table or the sky; and Rubble is something that might
# be portable but is otherwise useless, like trash or debris.
